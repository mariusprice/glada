# Bug Report

Here is a summary of the potential bugs and areas for improvement that I have found in the codebase:

**High Priority**

*   **Hardcoded Values:** There are many hardcoded values throughout the codebase, such as phone numbers, email addresses, company information, and API keys. These should be stored in environment variables or a central configuration file to make them easier to manage and update.
    *   **Files affected:** `app/page.tsx`, `app/about/page.tsx`, `app/contact/page.tsx`, `app/privacy-policy/page.tsx`, `app/actions/send-email.ts`, `app/services/[service]/[location]/page.tsx`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `components/footer.tsx`, `components/header.tsx`, `components/google-analytics.tsx`.

**Medium Priority**

*   **Generic Page Content:** The content on the dynamically generated service/location pages is a bit generic. It could be improved by adding more specific information about the services in each location.
    *   **File affected:** `app/services/[service]/[location]/page.tsx`.
*   **Typo:** There is a typo in the contact section of the service/location page: "Kontakta ons idag!". It should be "Kontakta oss idag!".
    *   **File affected:** `app/services/[service]/[location]/page.tsx`.
*   **HTML Email Templates:** The HTML email templates are inline in the `send-email.ts` action. They could be moved to separate files to improve readability and maintainability.
    *   **File affected:** `app/actions/send-email.ts`.

**Low Priority**

*   **Array Keys:** The `key` prop for some of the mapped arrays is the index. It is better to use a unique id for each item in the array.
    *   **Files affected:** `app/page.tsx`, `app/about/page.tsx`, `app/contact/page.tsx`.
*   **Long Function:** The `sendContactEmail` function is very long. It could be broken down into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability.
    *   **File affected:** `app/actions/send-email.ts`.
*   **Hardcoded Date:** The date in the privacy policy is hardcoded. It should be dynamic.
    *   **File affected:** `app/privacy-policy/page.tsx`.
